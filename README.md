# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


MileStone 1 was a case of connecting GutHub to the AiCore portal.

Milestone 2 we created a Python List and then used the RANDOM module to pick a random fruit.

Milestone 3: We asked the users for an input.  Namely a guess.

Milestone 4: We needed to check the input was a single character.

Milestone 5: Documentation.
