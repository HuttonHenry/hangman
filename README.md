# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


MileStone 1 was a case of connecting GutHub to the AiCore portal.

Milestone 2 we created a Python List and then used the RANDOM module to pick a random fruit.

Milestone 3: We asked the users for an input.  Namely a guess.

Milestone 4: We needed to check the input was a single character.

Milestone 5: Documentation.

TASK3:

You should use an if statement to check if the letter entered by the user is in the word. Remember that the input should be stored in a variable called "guess" and the randomly picked word should be stored in a variable called "word". You can use the "in" operator to check if a character is in a string. If you think you have done it correctly, remember to use the right indentation for the if statement and just a single space between the "if" keyword and the condition.
